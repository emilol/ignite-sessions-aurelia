You might as well barricade the doors because you simply will not be granted occupancy.  Builders know the laws requiring access prevent this from occurring.  The fines can cripple business.  Closed doors shut-down the income source.  The adverse publicity means customers will shop elsewhere and shops will be vacant.  If you considered building without full access, even for a moment, and thought you could get away with it - the risk would be unconscionable. Why then do we consider opening businesses where the digital shopfront is closed to at least 20% of the population - those who have disabilities? Actually, the potential loss is closer to 50% because there are other issues to consider such as English as a second language, limited literacy and multiple factors which when combined make digital access difficult. So why then, do we deny digital shopfront access for up to 50% of the people? Perhaps we're not convinced it is worth the investment, as with the physical shop front.","Details":{"Audience":"Developer, IT Professional, Hybrid","Topic":"Life Hack","Track":"Hack","Product":"Non Technical (Hack @ Ignite)","Duration":"20 minutes","Level":"Level 100"},"IsScheduled":false,"IsCommonSession":false,"SessionCss":""},{"EventSessionId":0,"EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"SessionId":2692,"Name":"Hacking, Citizen Science and Maker IoT  [MYMAZ1]","Speakers":[],"Schedule":{"StartDatetime":"2017-02-15T11:10:00.0000000","EndDatetime":"2017-02-15T11:30:00.0000000","Venue":"Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre","Room":"Microsoft Showcase","EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"Status":"Scheduled","IsToday":false,"FormattedVenueString":"Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre","FormattedStartDate":"Wed 15 Feb,  11:10 AM"},"Description":"The rise of the Maker movement and with it the availability of cost effective sensors, devices and fabrication services is an enabler for Citizen and Participatory Science projects. Could I use the approach and economies of scale maker community for IoT proof of concept projects?

Traditional IT projects tend to be monoliths, requiring lots of up-front planning because the cost of failure can be so high. The ROI of these projects is tied directly to the cost, so getting the infrastructure or software architecture wrong can be fatal. However, what happens when you no longer need to buy hardware or software licenses in advance? When architecture and solution delivery is realised through composition of existing services that use pay-for-use pricing models? In this session hear how you can realise increased agility with reduced risk for your projects by leveraging Microsoft Azure.","Details":{"Audience":"Hybrid","Topic":"IT & Cloud Infrastructure","Track":"Architecture","Product":"Azure","Duration":"75 minutes","Level":"Level 300"},"IsScheduled":false,"IsCommonSession":false,"SessionCss":""},{"EventSessionId":0,"EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"SessionId":2534,"Name":"Entity Framework Core and its journey so far [NET327b]","Speakers":[{"Id":"6963","Name":"Dipanjan Ghosh","LastName":"G","FirstName":"Dipanjan","IsMVP":false,"IsMicrosoftStaff":true,"PhotoPath":"","Twitterusername":"","LinkedInUrl":"https://au.linkedin.com/in/dipanjan-ghosh-2096857","Bio":"","Organisation":"Microsoft Australia"}],"Schedule":{"StartDatetime":"2017-02-15T18:30:00.0000000","EndDatetime":"2017-02-15T19:45:00.0000000","Venue":"Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre","Room":"Room 7 ","EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"Status":"Scheduled","IsToday":false,"FormattedVenueString":"Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre","FormattedStartDate":"Wed 15 Feb,  6:30 PM"},"Description":"Entity Framework (EF) is a popular data access technology for .NET applications.

Mode 2 is exploratory and experimental, embracing IT trends and innovation.\n\nHowever there seems to be mixed views on the subject. Some believe it’s either unrealistic and not easy, others understand that for organisations to survive, relying on mode 1 is not enough.\n\nHaving said that, the question Quest is asking, is if Bimodal IT is ‘a thing’ and has some merit, should it be adopted in such a way that Enterprise IT runs each mode independently without considering how one relates to the other? How can organisations confidently run Mode 2 without first ensuring Traditional IT (Mode 1) provides the required stability?\n\nFrom Quest’s perspective, Mode 2 is hugely dependent on Mode 1. When thinking about traditional IT services in most organisations, Active Directory provides the foundation of these services. Whether it be client device, file/print or collaboration platforms, on premise or in the cloud, Active Directory underpins it all.\n\nDuring this session, we’ll take a back to basics look at traditional IT’s ‘Active Directory’ and related services and explore the question ‘is it ready’?\n","Details":{"Audience":"Developer, IT Professional, Hybrid","Topic":"Innovation","Track":"Architecture","Product":"Azure Active Directory","Duration":"75 minutes","Level":"Level 200"},"IsScheduled":false,"IsCommonSession":false,"SessionCss":""},{"EventSessionId":0,"EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"SessionId":2632,"Name":"Skype video conferencing from Huddle Rooms to Boardrooms, and everything in-between.

However, in this case, you can create a storage space using a mixture of disk devices (SATA and NVMe) that are directly attached to the nodes in the cluster.\n\n• Storage Quality of Service (QoS). With Windows Server 2016, you can now create centralized policies for Storage QoS. You can create Storage QoS policies on a Scale-Out File Server and then assign these policies to one or more virtual disks.\n\n• Storage Replica. Storage Replica is a new feature that enables storage-agnostic, block-level, synchronous replication between servers for disaster recovery, as well as stretching of a failover cluster for high availability.\n\nThe virtual machines in this lab include Nano Server and nested visualization technologies.","Details":{"Audience":"IT Professional","Topic":"IT & Cloud Infrastructure","Track":"Microsoft Ignite Learning Zone","Product":"Windows Powershell","Duration":"75 minutes","Level":"Level 400"},"IsScheduled":false,"IsCommonSession":false,"SessionCss":""},{"EventSessionId":0,"EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"SessionId":2717,"Name":"Exploring Azure Managed Disks ","Speakers":[{"Id":"5684","Name":"Andrew Cobb","LastName":"C","FirstName":"Andrew","IsMVP":false,"IsMicrosoftStaff":true,"PhotoPath":"","Twitterusername":"","LinkedInUrl":"","Bio":"","Organisation":"Microsoft Australia"}],"Schedule":{"StartDatetime":"2017-02-17T13:00:00.0000000","EndDatetime":"2017-02-17T13:20:00.0000000","Venue":"Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre","Room":"Microsoft Showcase","EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"Status":"Scheduled","IsToday":false,"FormattedVenueString":"Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre","FormattedStartDate":"Fri 17 Feb,  1:00 PM"},"Description":"The release of Managed Disks for Azure virtual machines simplifies management and provides more flexible deployment options.\n\nWe will explore: \n•\tManaged disk objects\n•\tSnapshots\n•\t Creating virtual machines with managed disks\n•\tConverting between standard and premium storage.\n","Details":{"Audience":"Developer, IT Professional, Hybrid","Topic":"IT & Cloud Infrastructure","Track":"Expo","Product":"Azure","Duration":"20 minutes","Level":"Level 200"},"IsScheduled":false,"IsCommonSession":false,"SessionCss":""},{"EventSessionId":0,"EventSessionRegistrationId":0,"SessionId":2330,"Name":"3 Steps to Innovate and #HackTheStatusQuo [HCK142]","Speakers":[{"Id":"3183","Name":"Dux Raymond Sy","LastName":"R","FirstName":"Dux Raymond","IsMVP":true,"IsMicrosoftStaff":false,"PhotoPath":"https://msau01s1.blob.core.windows.net/profile/d76a1a0a-e47a-494f-b715-4ce8f1d56d72","Twitterusername":"meetdux","LinkedInUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meetdux","Bio":"With over 20 years of business & technology experience, Dux is the CTO of AvePoint.
